          <p class="bigger"><strong>An amulet is a small and inconspicuous item that brings good luck. Carry the
              protecting Feng Shui amulet in your purse or pocket, it will protect you from trouble.</strong></p>
          <h2>Amulets, charms and talismans, how do they work?</h2>
          <p>The talisman attracts success, wealth, fame, love to its owner ... In a word, what a person really needs
            for a specific period of time. One of the most famous talismans of the past is the ring of Genghis Khan,
            presented to him by his mother. The conqueror won all his numerous victories only when a ring with a large
            ruby ​​sparkled on his hand.</p>
          <p>Amulets and talismans have common features. The first is that they are only valid for your actual needs.
            The amulet will protect you exactly as much as you need, and the talisman will cease to function after it
            solves all the tasks assigned to it, for example, improves your financial situation.</p>
          <h2>How to choose a mascot?</h2>
          <p>You can receive talismans and amulets as a gift only from the closest and dearest people. This greatly
            enhances the magical power of the stone or other material from which the amulet is made. Loving people seem
            to imbue talismans with their care and love, which from the very first minute begins to warm you and give
            you positive emotions. If you have broken off relations with the donor, then it is best to get rid of the
            gift that has become an amulet or talisman.</p>
          <p>When making an independent choice, you should trust your intuition. We feel how close this or that stone is
            to us and this impression is rarely mistaken. Moreover, usually people choose amulets and talismans that
            exactly correspond to astrological or numerological recommendations.</p>
          <p>Talismans also differ by gender. So, women most often choose stones that help increase attractiveness in
            the eyes of the opposite sex, or those amulets that can save them from trouble on the personal front. Among
            the most popular "heart" talismans are blue topaz, pearls, amazonite, rose quartz, emerald and many other
            minerals. With the help of talismans, men often try to satisfy their career ambitions and achieve success in
            the material field. There are stones, the main role of which is to tune a person to the wave of success.
            These are tiger's eye and chrysoprase, Brazilian agate and topaz.</p>
